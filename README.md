# Platform Hero	
Platformer 2D game made in Unity.
This is my first take on making a platformer game in Unity. Contributions are welcomed.
## Play the game
Get the [latest release](https://github.com/videlanicolas/platformhero/releases) or play it at [itch.io](https://keliath.itch.io/native-american-run).
## Getting started
In order to contribute to the game you'll need the [Unity Editor](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).
After installing Unity, clone this repo via Git or download as a ZIP. Open Unity and add this directory as a new project, Unity will now load a whole bunch of code (this is one time only) and load the game for edit.
You can contribute by finding bugs and filing an issue in this repo, or by submitting pull requests to the code. These are the current [projects](https://github.com/videlanicolas/platformhero/projects) I'm working on.
