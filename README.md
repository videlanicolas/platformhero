# Platform Hero	
Platformer 2D game made in Unity.
## Getting started
The game has not been uploaded to itch.io yet, will upload it once we have a release of a stable game.
In order to play the game you'll need the [Unity Editor](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).
After installing Unity, clone this repo via Git or download as a ZIP. Open Unity and add this directory as a new project, Unity will now load a whole bunch of code (this is one time only) and load the game for edit. You can now just press "play" and play the game.
## How to contribute
You can contribute by finding bugs and filing an issue in this repo, or by submitting pull requests to the code. These are the current [projects](https://github.com/videlanicolas/platformhero/projects) I'm working on.
